## Overview
This project is an introduction to js programing and DOM manupliation within a script. The program is pure html, css, and js.

## Strategy
By orginizing the TicTacToe board within a html table, when rendering the board in js I added eventListners to every "cell" or tb tag.
For every click on a cell a check is performed to determine if a there is a winner. This winner check is done by refrencing a table of all winning combos.
